* Take a look at our [todo list](https://github.com/CoinTK/BitBox-Server/blob/master/TODO.md)
* Browse through (and shoot down) some [bugs](https://github.com/cointk/bitbox-server/issues)
* Shoot an email to `agajews@gmail.com` to get added to the cointk.slack.com channel

## Testing
TBD

First bugs for contributors
  * When we start finding bugs, we'll add something here!

## New Feature Requirements
When proposing new features either on slack or as github issues, make sure to include an intended use case. Yes, it would be nice if BitBox could fly airplanes and blast music at strangers, we'd like to know why you want BitBox to do these things.

## Style Guide / Coding conventions
Try to follow PEP8, and please use a linter. Pull requests that are not properly linted will be rejected until that has been fixed.

Please be courteous to others and thoughtful before sharing potentially hurtful opinions.
