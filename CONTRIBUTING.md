# Contibuting to CoinTK + BitBox

Welcome to the BitBox contributing page! We're super excited you've taken an interest in this project. Also check out [CoinTK](https://github.com/CoinTK/CoinTK), the strategy development and backtesting framework BitBox is built on, and [BitBox iOS](https://github.com/cointk/bitbox), the accompanying iOS app for the BitBox server.

## Quickstart
* Take a look at our [todo list](https://github.com/CoinTK/BitBox-Server/blob/master/TODO.md)
* Browse through (and shoot down) some [bugs](https://github.com/cointk/bitbox-server/issues)
* Shoot an email to `agajews@gmail.com` to get added to the cointk.slack.com channel

## Testing
TBD

## Development environment details
Make sure you're running Python 3.3+, as some of the dynamic module loading requires relatively new features.

## New Feature Requirements
When proposing new features either on slack or as github issues, make sure to include an intended use case. Yes, it would be nice if BitBox could fly airplanes and blast music at strangers, we'd like to know why you want BitBox to do these things.
